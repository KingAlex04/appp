# Staff Tracker Deployment Status

## Deployed Backend

The Staff Tracker backend has been successfully deployed to Render.com and is accessible at:

**URL:** [https://appp-bx2c.onrender.com](https://appp-bx2c.onrender.com)

**Status:** Running in DEMO mode

## Deployment Details

- **Platform:** Render.com (Free tier)
- **Mode:** DEMO (Running without Firebase credentials)
- **Authentication:** Enabled, requires JWT token
- **Default Users:** 
  - Admin: `admin` / `admin123`
  - User: `user` / `user123`

## Android App Configuration

The Android app has been configured to use the deployed backend with these files:

1. `ApiConfig.kt` - Contains the API URL and endpoint configurations
2. `ApiService.kt` - Implements the Retrofit service for API communication
3. `StaffRepository.kt` - Provides repository pattern implementation for data access

## Keep-Alive Service

A keep-alive service has been set up to prevent the free Render.com instance from going idle:

- Script: `keep-appp-alive.js`
- Ping interval: 10 minutes
- Target: [https://appp-bx2c.onrender.com](https://appp-bx2c.onrender.com)

## Testing Results

The backend has been tested and verified to be running. Authentication is required for accessing protected endpoints.

## Next Steps

1. **Optional: Configure Firebase**
   - Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Generate a service account key
   - Add the Firebase configuration to Render.com environment variables

2. **Keep the Service Running**
   - Run the keep-alive script on a reliable machine
   - Alternatively, set up a free service like UptimeRobot to ping the URL regularly

3. **Monitor Usage**
   - Render.com free tier has limitations (750 hours/month)
   - Monitor usage through the Render dashboard

4. **Testing in Production**
   - Use the test scripts to verify functionality
   - Test the Android app with the deployed backend

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Service is down**
   - Check Render.com dashboard
   - Verify the keep-alive script is running
   - Manually restart the service if needed

2. **Authentication issues**
   - Check if the JWT_SECRET environment variable is set in Render.com
   - Verify login credentials

3. **Firebase connectivity**
   - Check Firebase service account configuration
   - Verify the FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT environment variable
